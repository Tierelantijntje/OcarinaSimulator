OcarinaSimulator
A short python program that emulates the Ocarina from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Sounds supplied by HelpTheWretched over on zeldasounds.com, and property of Nintendo probably.

This is pretty much the first program I've ever made, so don't expect too much. I only found files for the five base notes, If I ever find more for the sharps and flats, I'll add them.

Sounds are supplied by HelpTheWretched, over on https://www.zeldasounds.com, 
alternately you can download a zip with all their OoT instrument sounds from https://www.noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/OOT/OOT_Notes.zip 

For the tabs of the in-game songs, go to 
https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Ocarina_of_Time_Songs or 
https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Majora%27s_Mask_Songs 

If you are having problems, make sure you've installed Pygame, and your path for the .wav files is set correctly.

By default the five notes are set to 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
To transcribe From the N64 input to keyboard numpad: A = 0, CDown = 2, CLeft = 4, CRight = 6, CUp = 8.
